Collect the data and save in a CSV File.

 

Then, analyze your CSV File to check for strategies to divide the institutions in three (3) groups:

1. The institutions that could be peer institutions of Fisk University (same level)

2.  The institutions that are below us.

3. The institutions that are above us.

 

You can use any technique (or multiple techniques) to classify the institutions.
